# Differentiation between pancreatic ductal carcinoma. pancreatitis and control  patients from liquid biopsy data using machine learning

Classification between pancreatic ductal carcinoma, pancreatitis and control using machine learning techniques.

## Data acquisition

The plasma data used to find the genetic signature can be downloaded from the [GEO serie webpage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133684).


## Usage

All the analysis is performed using the [main.R](main.R) script. The only requirement is the KnowSeq Bioc/R Package. You can download it from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KnowSeq.html).
