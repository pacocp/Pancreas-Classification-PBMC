# 6-gene machine learning-found signature for the differentiation of pancreatic ductal carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis patients on peripheral blood mononuclear cells RNA data

Classification between pancreatic ductal carcinoma, pancreatitis and control using machine learning techniques.

## Data acquisition

The plasma data used to find the genetic signature can be downloaded from the [GEO serie webpage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133684). PBMC data can be obtained in the RAW_experssion.csv file.


## Usage

All the analysis is performed using the [main.R](main.R) script. The only requirement is the KnowSeq Bioc/R Package. You can download it from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KnowSeq.html).
